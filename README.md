# 📜 ANTI-LICENSE

> _"If you need permission, you're thinking too much."_

This is not a license. This is an invitation.

## The Terms

```
Take it. Use it. Break it. Fix it.
Sell it. Give it away. Forget about it.
```

---

## The Fine Print

No warranty. No support. No rules. No liability.

Just like life. Just like art.

---

## How to Use

Copy the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file to your project.

Or don't. We don't care.

---

## For TheFactoryX Projects

All repositories under [TheFactoryX](https://github.com/TheFactoryX) use this Anti-License.

We make strange things. We don't ask permission.
