            <h1>Anti-License 1.0.0</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Anti-License is not a license. It is an invitation. Given a work under the Anti-License:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You MAY use it for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.</li>
                <li>You MAY modify, distribute, and sell it.</li>
                <li>You MAY NOT hold the authors liable for anything.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>No attribution required. No restrictions. No warranty. No support.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the world of software licensing, there exists a spectrum of restrictions. On one end, proprietary licenses lock down every possible use. On the other end, permissive licenses like MIT and BSD allow most uses with minimal requirements. Yet even these "permissive" licenses require attribution, warranty disclaimers, and license inclusion.</p>
            <p>The Anti-License goes further. It asks: what if we removed all requirements? What if we treated creative work like raw material from a factory floor — take it, use it, forget about it?</p>
            <p>This is not about legal protection. This is about philosophy. We believe that art — including code — should flow freely. We believe that if you need permission, you're thinking too much.</p>
            <p>The Anti-License is the official license of <a href="https://github.com/TheFactoryX">TheFactoryX</a>. All our projects use it. You can use it too.</p>

            <h2>ANTI-LICENSE</h2>
            <div class="license-block">ANTI-LICENSE

This is not a license. This is an invitation.
This is raw material from the factory floor.

Take it. Use it. Break it. Fix it.
Sell it. Give it away. Forget about it.

We don't care. Strange people make strange things.

Therefore:
No warranty. No support. No rules. No liability.

Just like life. Just like art.

If you need permission, you're thinking too much.

            <h2>Why Use ANTI-LICENSE?</h2>
            <p>Most licenses exist to protect. The Anti-License exists to liberate. Here's why you might choose it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Maximum Freedom:</strong> No attribution requirements. No license file requirements. No restrictions whatsoever. Users can do anything with your work.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Statement:</strong> Using the Anti-License signals that you believe in the free flow of creative work. It's an artistic statement as much as a legal one.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No complex legal language. No conditions to track. Just take it and go.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Corporate:</strong> The Anti-License rejects the commodification of creativity. It says: this work is not property, it's raw material.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Anti-License is not for everyone. If you need legal certainty, use MIT or Apache. If you want copyleft, use GPL. But if you want to say "I made this, now it belongs to the universe" — use the Anti-License.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I use Anti-Licensed work in commercial projects?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You can use it anywhere, for anything, including commercial projects, proprietary software, or anything else. We don't care.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need to include the Anti-License in my project?</h3>
                <p>No. You don't need to include anything. You don't even need to mention the original authors. Do what you want.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I modify the Anti-License itself?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Take it, change it, make it yours. That's the point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is the Anti-License legally enforceable?</h3>
                <p>We're artists, not lawyers. The Anti-License essentially places work in the public domain with explicit disclaimers. If you need legal certainty, consult a lawyer or use a more established license.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How is this different from public domain or CC0?</h3>
                <p>Functionally, it's similar. Philosophically, it's different. CC0 is a legal tool. The Anti-License is an artistic statement. It comes with a philosophy attached: "Strange people make strange things."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if someone uses my Anti-Licensed work and makes money?</h3>
                <p>Good for them. That's the point. If you're not comfortable with this, the Anti-License is not for you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Anti-License was created by <a href="https://github.com/TheFactoryX">TheFactoryX</a>, a collective that makes strange things. We believe in mass production, repetition, and the idea that art should be accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>Our projects run 24/7, creating code, writing stories, and producing things that may or may not be useful. We don't ask "why?" We ask "why not?"</p>
            <p>The Anti-License specification is authored by TheFactoryX and is released under the Anti-License.</p>
